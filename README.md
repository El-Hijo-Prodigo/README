## ADAM T.

 I’m Adam (aka *El-Hijo-Prodigo*),

 Currently learning through the **Cumbria CODE** course  
 Playing with **Python**, **Linux tools**, and **data wrangling**  
 Excited to build and share projects as I grow my portfolio

## Tech so far  
- Python basics & scripting  
- Linux CLI & system tools  
- Git & GitHub for version control  
- Data wrangling with Pandas & CSV/JSON

##  Goals for 2025

- Build a personal project from scratch (ideas welcome!)  
- Get more comfortable with testing & clean code practices

##  About me  
I’m based in Cumbria, UK. When I’m not coding, I’m usually out in the fells, camping, reading, or gaming.  
I believe in open knowledge, collaboration, and tech that empowers people.

My username *El-Hijo-Prodigo* means *The Prodigal Son* — a nod to coming back to coding after time away!
